Weather App Instructions

1. Homepage

When you visit the homepage of the Weather App, you'll see a clean and simple user interface.
2. Searching for Weather

At the top of the page, there is a search input field labeled "Enter location (e.g., city or ZIP code)." You can use this field to manually enter a location for which you want to check the weather.

Type the name of a city, a ZIP code, or any location you want to know the weather for.

Click the "Get Weather" button to trigger the weather request for the entered location.

3. Displaying Weather Data

Once you click the "Get Weather" button, the application will display the current weather conditions for the specified location.

You'll see details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.

4. Error Handling

If you enter an invalid or non-existent location, or if there's an issue with the API request, the application will gracefully handle errors. It will display a user-friendly error message, guiding you on how to proceed.
5. Unit Selection

You can switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) based on your preference. Below the search field, there is a unit toggle with radio buttons. Select either "Celsius" or "Fahrenheit" to switch between temperature units.

The weather data will update accordingly when you change the unit.

6. Geolocation (Optional)

If you prefer not to manually enter a location, you can use the "Use My Location" button. This feature requests your browser's geolocation data (requires permission) and automatically fetches the weather for your current location.

If geolocation is supported and permission is granted, the application will display the weather for your current coordinates.

In case of geolocation errors or permission denial, clear instructions will be provided on how to proceed.

7. Styling and Responsiveness

The application is styled for a pleasant user experience. It includes a color scheme, layout, and fonts that are easy on the eyes.

The app is responsive and designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring usability on various screen sizes.

8. Footer

At the bottom of the page, there is a footer with a copyright notice.
Please note that to use this application, you need to replace the placeholder API key in the script.js file with your own API key from the chosen weather API provider. The API key is essential for fetching weather data.

Enjoy using the Weather App to stay updated on current weather conditions for any location you choose!
