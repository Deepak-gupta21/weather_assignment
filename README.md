# Weather App User Guide

Welcome to the Weather App! This guide will help you understand how to use the application effectively and what to expect in terms of features and functionality.

## Homepage

- When you open the Weather App, you'll find a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Searching for Weather

- At the top of the page, you'll see a search input field labeled "Enter location (e.g., city or ZIP code)." Use this field to manually enter a location for which you want to check the weather.

- Type the name of a city, a ZIP code, or any location you'd like to know the weather for.

- Click the "Get Weather" button to trigger the weather request for the entered location.

## Displaying Weather Data

- After clicking "Get Weather," the application will display the current weather conditions for the specified location.

- You'll receive details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.

## Error Handling

- If you enter an invalid or non-existent location, or if there's an issue with the API request, the application will handle errors gracefully. It will display a user-friendly error message, guiding you on how to proceed.

## Unit Selection

- Customize the temperature unit to match your preference. Below the search field, you'll find a unit toggle with radio buttons. Choose either "Celsius" or "Fahrenheit" to switch between temperature units.

- The weather data will update automatically to reflect your chosen unit.

## Geolocation (Optional)

- If you prefer not to manually enter a location, you can use the "Use My Location" button. This feature requests your browser's geolocation data (requires permission) and automatically fetches the weather for your current location.

- When geolocation is supported and permission is granted, the application will display the weather for your current coordinates.

- In case of geolocation errors or permission denial, clear instructions will be provided on how to proceed.

## Styling and Responsiveness

- The application is thoughtfully styled for an enjoyable user experience. It incorporates a color scheme, layout, and fonts designed for readability and aesthetics.

- Expect the app to be responsive, working seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. It has been tested to ensure usability on various screen sizes.

## Footer

- At the bottom of the page, you'll find a footer with a copyright notice.

Please note that to use this application, you must replace the placeholder API key in the `script.js` file with your own API key from the chosen weather API provider. The API key is essential for fetching weather data.

Enjoy using the Weather App to stay informed about current weather conditions for any location you choose!
